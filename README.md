# 🌱 Smart Plant Watering Prediction System

### Integrating Agricultural Knowledge with Automation

---

## 📖 Overview

This project leverages **Machine Learning and Automation** to predict whether plants require watering based on environmental and soil parameters. By analyzing sensor data and applying predictive models, the system helps optimize water usage, prevent overwatering or underwatering, and support sustainable farming practices.

The model is trained using real-world agricultural datasets to enhance decision-making for smart irrigation systems.

## 💡 Key Features

* 🌾 Predicts whether a plant needs watering using ML algorithms
* 📊 Performs data preprocessing (handling missing values, scaling, encoding)
* 🧠 Implements a **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** classifier for prediction
* 📈 Includes detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualizations
* 🔍 Scalable model ready for IoT integration with smart sensors

## 🧩 Dataset

**Dataset Source:** [Kaggle - Dataset for Predicting Watering the Plants](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nelakurthisudheer/dataset-for-predicting-watering-the-plants)

The dataset includes features such as:

* Temperature
* Humidity
* Soil Moisture
* Light Intensity
* Rainfall
* Wind Speed
* and other environmental metrics

The target variable **“Status”** indicates whether watering is needed (`1`) or not (`0`).

Input sample:

```python
input_data = (5,23,27,4,21.44,5.8,28.38,22.67,101.46,7.375482851,224.0581164,98,47,37)
```

Output:

```python
Prediction: [1]  # Indicates watering is required
```
